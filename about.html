            <h1>Charity Community</h1>
            <sub>The Future is Equal</sub>
            <span>We raise funds to improve the living standards of marginalised communities. Charity is essential and therefore meant to be done for public benefit, relief and to provide assistance to people at times of need in any part of the world, especially those who are the victims of war, natural disaster, catastrophe, hunger, disease, poverty, orphans by supplying them with food, shelter, medical aid, and other fundamental needs.</span>
            <span>Such charitable purposes can gain momentum from advancing the education of young people for the public benefit by making grants and awards to students in full-time education. When considering poverty in the developing world, people feel deep sorrow but seem to put no effort whatsoever to reduce or eradicate the problem. Poverty in today’s world has turned out to be sinister and we lay passive towards the problem, therefore such attitude has made us powerless to stop it.</span>
            <span>Since this world has been created it’s been unequal in every way and there will always be rich and poor, strong and weak living together. While poverty is extreme and widespread, let’s not forget just how many rich and wealthy people there are in the developed world capable of giving. It’s high time we must realize the power that we have in our hands when pooled together. When everyone is giving to an effective charity, the size of our donation would directly correspond to the number of people we are able to help. We don’t have to be a millionaire to make a significant difference. Just as every drop in the ocean counts to form a vast water mass, even small donations have the potential to drastically improve an individual’s quality of life.</span>
